      "You: hello",
      "Puck: Hello! I am Puck, your hospital booking assistant. I can help you book an appointment. First, can you tell me the patient's name, their symptoms, and which department they need to see?",
      "You: my name is Fatima and I would like to book an appointment",
      "Puck: Okay Fatima, I can help you with that. Could you please tell me your symptoms and which department you'd like to book an appointment with?",
      "You: I have",
      "Puck: Could you please share your symptoms and the department you'd like to book an appointment with?",
      "You: adjustable and back pain",
      "Puck: Okay, I understand. And which department would you like to book an appointment with for your adjustable and back pain?",
      "You: it's just pain and back pain",
      "Puck: Okay, I understand that you have pain and back pain. Which department would you like to book an appointment with? I can suggest Orthopedics or Neurology, depending on the type of pain.",
      "You: the topic space",
      "Puck: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Could you please clarify which department you would like to book an appointment with for your pain and back pain?",
      "You: orthopedics",
      "Puck: Okay, you would like to book an appointment with the Orthopedics department for your pain and back pain. Let me check the availability. Do you have a preferred doctor?",
      "You: any",
      "Puck: Okay, I will check for any available doctor in the Orthopedics department. Please wait a moment.",
      "You: hello are you there",
      "Puck: Yes, I am here. I am checking the availability for you. One moment please.",
      "You: hello hello",
      "Puck: Yes, I'm still here. I'm still looking into the availability for the Orthopedics department. I will let you know as soon as I have some information.",
      "You: how long is it going to take tight and inher",
      "Puck: I apologize for the delay. I am still waiting for the availability information from the system. In the meantime, can you confirm that the patient's name is Fatima and the symptoms are pain and back pain, and the department is Orthopedics? This will help me book the appointment quickly once a slot is available.",
      "You: I have chest pain and blackpink",
      "Puck: Okay, I understand you have chest pain. Regarding the department, would you prefer Cardiology for your chest pain, or are you still interested in Orthopedics for your back pain? Please clarify and confirm the symptoms you'd like me to address.",
      "You: can I solve both in one department",
      "Puck: It's unlikely that both chest pain and back pain can be addressed in one department. Cardiology is the right choice for chest pain, and Orthopedics is generally best for back pain. However, a general practitioner might be able to assess both initially and then refer you to specialists. Would you like to see a general practitioner?",
      "You: highest general public",
      "Puck: I'm sorry, I don't understand. Did you mean 'general public' or would you like to see a 'general practitioner'?",
      "You: yes generator",

      "You: makeup kit",
      "Puck: I am sorry, I cannot help you with 'makeup kit'. I can only help you with booking a hospital appointment. I am checking the availability of a general practitioner for you.",
      "You: main cricket fast",
      "Puck: I am sorry, I cannot understand what you mean by 'main cricket fast.' I am here to help you book a hospital appointment with a general practitioner. Are you still interested in that?",
      "You: make it quick",
      "Puck: I am trying my best to get the availability for a general practitioner as quickly as possible. Please wait a moment.",
      "You: you take me so long I don't have time",
      "Puck: I understand. I am still waiting for the system to respond with the availability. Would you like me to proceed with booking the first available slot for a general practitioner, or would you prefer to try again later?",
      "You: Yes book the first available shop",
      "Puck: Okay, I will book the first available slot for you with a general practitioner. Can you confirm the patient's name is Fatima and the symptoms are chest pain and back pain?",
